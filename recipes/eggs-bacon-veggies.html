    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sometimes simple breakfasts are the best breakfasts. After all, most of us are rushing out of the door in the morning and need something quick and easy. That morning meal also needs to be satisfying to keep us full and energized all day. But most importantly, it should be a healthy and smart option that fits into a weight loss plan. While cooking up a warm egg breakfast may seem like a complicated task to squeeze into your morning, that’s not always the case! This Turkey Bacon Scrambled Eggs recipe is the perfect example.</p>
    <p>Submitted by Nutrisystem member Stacey, this easy scrambled egg dish comes together quickly in one single skillet. It’s got protein-packed eggs AND turkey bacon, plus a medley of non-starchy vegetables to fill you up with fiber. Stacey describes it best: “Stacked full of protein and vegetables.”</p>
