    <h2 class="odin-heading-2">Description</h2>
    <em class="odin-em">“Guaranteed to turn any feast into a party… or a prank gone wrong. Proceed with caution!”</em>
    <p class="odin-text">Legend has it that this honey mead was Loki’s favorite drink—after all, what better way to fuel a day of mischief than with a few flagons of fermented fun? Vikings may have loved mead, but Loki made it an art form, slipping it into feasts to get Thor singing out-of-tune ballads and causing Odin to lose at arm-wrestling. This simplified recipe brings the trickster's brew straight to your home, perfect for pranks or a good old-fashioned toast to chaos!</p>
    <h3 class="odin-heading-3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="odin-text">
        <li>Honey: As sweet as Loki’s lies (and just as sticky).</li>
        <li>Water: Enough to drown your worries… or a few mortal enemies.</li>
        <li>Yeast: For that magical fermentation process that’ll have you feeling like you just pulled off the ultimate trick.</li>
        <li>Optional herbs and spices: Loki often added a dash of something extra—just to keep things interesting (or mildly concerning).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="odin-heading-3">Directions</h3>
    <ol class="odin-text">
        <li>Combine the honey and water in a large pot. Stir gently, as if you were carefully weaving a web of deception to prank your least favorite god.</li>
        <li>Heat until the honey dissolves, but don’t let it boil over—unless you want your kitchen to resemble Loki's chaotic energy.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture cool down, because even Loki knows when to slow down and bide his time (before causing more trouble).</li>
        <li>Once cooled, add the yeast with a flourish, as if you were casting a spell (or hex) on unsuspecting guests.</li>
        <li>Cover and let it ferment for 2-3 weeks, giving Loki plenty of time to plot his next scheme.</li>
        <li>After fermentation, bottle the mead and let it age, preferably somewhere safe from Thor’s hammer (or your nosy neighbors).</li>
        <li>Once ready, serve in Viking-sized mugs and brace yourself—because with Loki’s brew, you never know what will happen next..</li>
    </ol>
